    "In determining the coffee best suited to the professor's preferences, we followed a systematic approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Preferences**: We started by understanding the professor's preferences, which were provided as a set of criteria including aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, sweetness, and moisture. These preferences were specified as scores ranging from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated stronger preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering the Dataset**: We then filtered the coffee dataset based on the professor's preferences. We retained only those coffee varieties that closely matched the specified preference scores. A tolerance of Â±2.5 was applied to each preference score to allow for some flexibility in the matching process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adjusted Weighting**: Additionally, we incorporated the professor's preference for a large portion of drinks by considering the bag weight (portion size) more heavily in the filtering process. This ensured that the recommended coffee varieties would match not only in taste but also in portion size.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating Similarity**: To find the closest match, we calculated the Euclidean distance between each coffee variety in the filtered dataset and the professor's preferences. This distance metric allowed us to quantify how closely each coffee variety aligned with the specified preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Selecting the Closest Match**: Finally, we selected the coffee variety with the smallest Euclidean distance as the closest match to the professor's preferences. This coffee variety was considered the best suited to the professor's taste preferences and portion size preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this approach, we ensured that the recommended coffee variety not only matched the professor's taste preferences for aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, balance, sweetness, and moisture but also aligned with their preference for a large portion size.\n"
